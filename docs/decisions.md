# Decisions — Accuphy Visual Lab

Numbered log. Newest at the bottom.

1. **2026-09-24** — Repo created as a standalone project separate from
   `accuphy-rma-portal`; plain HTML/CSS first, framework to be decided.

2. **2026-09-23** — Stack chosen for interactive design work: **Vite + React +
   Tailwind CSS 4 + Framer Motion** (plain JS, no backend). Replaces the
   "plain HTML first" placeholder from #1. Rationale: fast hot-reload for
   trying ideas, real interactivity/animation, and same React+Tailwind basis
   as the Partner Portal so approved designs can be ported without rewriting.
   Experiments now live at `src/experiments/<date>-<slug>/index.jsx` and are
   auto-listed on a gallery page. GSAP / Three.js can be added per experiment;
   migrating to Next.js/Astro is a later decision if the lab becomes the real
   site.

3. **2026-09-23** — First real experiment: **Sonar Beam Visualizer** for
   PingLive / PingLive Mini (marketing page for accuphy.com / Shopify).
   Full brief in `docs/sonar-beam-visualizer-brief.md` (carried over from
   Jason's Chat discussion). Key locked-in facts: beam angles (PingLive 135°,
   Mini 39°, Mini Combo 78°), hybrid procedural sonar rendering with ray-cast
   acoustic shadows, WebGL (PixiJS or three.js — pick at Phase 2/3), single
   embeddable HTML output, desktop + touch. Reference recordings and product
   images go under `reference/` (gitignored if large).

4. **2026-09-23** — Phase 1 started: reference clips catalogued with Jason's
   annotations (`reference/clips.md`), frames extracted with a project-local
   `ffmpeg-static` (no system ffmpeg on the Mac), first draft of
   `docs/sonar-style.md`. Findings: (a) colour mode is app-wide, both
   palettes apply to both devices; (b) the app draws with non-uniform px/m
   (horizontal stretch) — engine works in metres, never copies screen angles;
   (c) yellow mode does not tint the beam area, blue/red mode fills it navy.
   *Correction (Jason, same day):* the RPReplay clips' 40/60 axis numbers are
   **feet** — the app was in imperial; only a printed unit counts.

5. **2026-09-23** — Jason: (a) **yellow colour mode first**; more app palettes
   later. (b) Abbreviations **PL = PingLive, PLM = PingLive Mini**. (c) Max
   *range* (horizontal) and *depth range* (vertical): PL 240 ft / 240 ft,
   PLM 200 ft — user-adjustable in the app, so the visualiser exposes a
   display-range control clamped per device. (d) After research
   (`docs/research.md`): render with **three.js + React Three Fiber + custom
   GLSL** using a polar shadow-map + shade pass; water-surface / drag feel via
   **three-fluid-fx** (or the inspiration site's tiny CPU flow-field trick);
   host the built page on Cloudflare Pages/Vercel and embed in Shopify via a
   Custom Liquid iframe section.

6. **2026-09-23** — Phase 2 geometry prototype shipped as
   `src/experiments/2026-09-23-sonar-beam/` (three.js + R3F full-screen shader,
   placeholder lake drawn procedurally). Working assumptions, all tunable in
   the on-screen debug controls and **to be confirmed by Jason**:
   (a) **Forward View = Down fan rotated forward by one full beam width**, so
   Down + Forward are contiguous (PLM 39°+39° = 78° Combo, as in the clips);
   clamped so the leading edge never rises above the surface (PL: 22.5° tilt →
   leading edge horizontal). (b) Scene is a 60 m-wide side view, surface at
   1/3 height. (c) Display range slider in ft (tap to toggle m), clamped to the
   device max from decision #5; engine uses metres. (d) Mouse hover moves the
   device; touch requires a drag. Device cursor is a placeholder shape until
   side-view PNGs exist.
